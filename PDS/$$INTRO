Hi Sam

Some answers:

1 MbrList is for use on-line whereas MbrListB is a batch version.

2 MbrList can be run interpreted, but I use it compiled and
  linked with the CPPL/EFPL stub.

3 MbrListC is the jcl for demonstrating MbrListB which must be
  compiled and linked with the MVS stub.

4 The idea behind MbrList was the recurrent need to produce very
  quickly a list of PDS members. Altho' this can be done with the
  library routines they require both ISPF and TSO, MbrList works
  in native MVS.

  As it happens I use it almost exclusively on-line as I am
  developing a Windows-like interface in ISPF. As I said earlier,
  the batch version is just to demonstrate that neither TSO nor
  ISPF services are required.

5 The output can be stacked (option not null) or written to a
  sequential dataset (option is null) called prefix.MEMBER.LIST.

6 The copyright notice is only there in case somebody else tries
  to make money from the code. The programs may be copied and
  distributed freely but not by way of trade. I hope that's okay!


Regards
Adrian

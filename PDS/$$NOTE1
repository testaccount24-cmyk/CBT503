Hi Sam,

1  I don't have any JCL as I use an on-line routine to compile execs.
   There are so many possible combinations etc it was too messy having
   to edit jcl. And why not compile on-line?
   However I'm sure I could produce some specifically for these programs
   if required.

2  To run the jcl:

   (a) replace "yourHlq.SPF.LOAD" with the name of your load module
       library.

   (b) replace "pds to be listed" with the name of the pds for which
       you require a member list.

   (c) add a jobcard.

   (d) submit for execution.

Regards
Adrian
